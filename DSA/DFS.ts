// Depth first search
// O(n) - Uses less mem than BFS and great for finding if a path exists, however it can get slow w/ time

// PROS:
// - Uses less mem than BFS.
// - Finding if a path exists.
// - If a tree is very wide.
// - If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree.
// - Determining whether a path exists between two nodes.

// CONS:
// - Can get slow with time.
